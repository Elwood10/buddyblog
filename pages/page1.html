<div>
    <p>My <a href="pug-2660487_1920.jpg">Pug</a> lineage began in ancient China, in the time of the Mongols. We spread through out Europe with no restraint and eventually made it across the vast ocean dividing the Earth's land masses. Upon reaching new shores, my ancestors began a union with the royal line of <a href="chihuahua-618480 (1).jpg">Chihuahuas.</a> This entwining was the  beginning of <a href="IMG_2519.jpg">Chug</a> domination of the New Americas.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        As the new dominant species, we wanted to assimilate with the various locals, and leave Buddhism behind, but being unable to confess our sins, or even see the possibility of sin in our nature, we were declined admittance to the <a href="IMG_3056.jpg">Catholic Church.</a>
